# PSoC 6 MCU: Tuning CapSense Over BLE - Server

This code example demonstrates how to monitor the CapSense® data and tune the CapSense sensors over BLE communication with CapSense Tuner GUI using PSoC® 6 BLE MCU.

## Overview

This code example has two applications:

1. **Tuning CapSense Over BLE - Server**: This design has a self-capacitance (CSD) based 5-segment CapSense slider and two mutual capacitance (CSX) based CapSense buttons. It has a PSoC 6 BLE MCU configured as BLE peripheral GATT Server that sends CapSense raw data to the GATT Client. This project should be run on a board with CapSense sensors that needs to be tuned over BLE communication.

2. **Tuning CapSense Over BLE - Client** The design has a PSoC 6 BLE MCU configured as GATT Client to receive CapSense raw data from a GATT Server. It also has an EZI2C interface to communicate with the CapSense Tuner GUI. This project needs to be run on a board that has BLE capability and has a connection to the CapSense Tuner GUI through EZI2C interface.

**NOTE**: This code example shows the BLE GATT server-side of the example project. See [PSoC 6 MCU: Tuning CapSense Over BLE - Client](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-ble-capsense-tuner-client) for the BLE GATT client-side of the project.

## Design and Implementation

### Tuning CapSense Over BLE - Server

The design has a PSoC 6 BLE MCU configured as a GAP Peripheral and a GATT Server with custom service *CapSense_Tuner*. This service has two custom characteristics: *CapSense_DS* and *Tuner_Command*. The *CapSense_DS* characteristic is loaded with the CapSense context structure *cy_capsense_tuner*. The *Tuner_Command* characteristic is used to receive command packets from the GATT Client received from CapSense Tuner.

The design also has a CSD-based, 5-segment CapSense slider and two CSX-based CapSense buttons.  The project uses the CapSense middleware. See [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/504361/download) for more details on selecting a middleware. See [AN85951 – PSoC 4 and PSoC 6 MCU CapSense Design Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an85951-psoc-4-and-psoc-6-mcu-capsense-design-guide) for more details of CapSense features and usage.

#### Firmware Flow

When the kit is powered up, the CapSense and the BLE blocks are initialized. The PSoC 6 device is configured as BLE GAP Peripheral and GATT Server. The BLE initialization function initializes the BLE stack and registers the BLE stack event handler (an application-level callback function to process BLE events). The *tuner_send_callback* function (an application-level callback function to facilitate data transmission using BLE) is registered in the CapSense middleware to send the CapSense context structure *cy_capsense_tuner* to the GATT Client.

When the BLE connection to the GATT Client device is successful, the USER_LED1 will turn ON.

After a successful BLE connection, the GATT Client enables the notifications of the *CapSense_DS* characteristic using Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD). Once notifications are enabled, the tuner bridge initialization parameters such as size of CapSense context structure and the number of notification packets required to send the complete CapSense context structure is sent to the peer GATT Client device.

The application periodically scans the CapSense buttons for user inputs. The **Cy_CapSense_RunTuner()** function is called periodically in the application program to establish synchronized communication with the CapSense Tuner application. The **Cy_CapSense_RunTuner()** function calls the user-registered callback function *tuner_send_callback* to send the CapSense data structure *cy_capsense_tuner*  to the GATT Client. The *cy_capsense_tuner* structure is sent as notification packets using the *CapSense_DS* characteristic.

When you change the CapSense hardware parameters such as resolution, number of sub-conversions, and so on from the CapSense Tuner GUI, the Tuner GUI modifies the CapSense context structure. The GATT Server receives this as a write command through the *Tuner_Command* characteristic. The write command contains the offset address of the CapSense context structure that is modified, actual data modified, and the number of bytes modified by the CapSense Tuner. The application is notified of this event through the BLE stack event handler. The application then modifies the CapSense context structure directly using this information.

### Tuning CapSense Over BLE - Client

The design has a PSoC 6 BLE MCU configured as BLE GAP Central and GATT Client with custom service *CapSense_Tuner*. The design also uses a serial communication block  (SCB) configured as EZIZC to establish I2C communication with the onboard KitProg, which enables the CapSense Tuner to read the CapSense raw data. The CapSense Tuner is a stand-alone tool that runs on PC, and is included in the ModusToolbox software to tune CapSense applications.

#### Firmware Flow

When the kit is powered up, the BLE and SCB (configured as EZI2C) blocks are initialized. The BLE initialization function initializes the BLE stack and registers the BLE stack event handler (an application-level callback function to process BLE events).

When the BLE connection to the GATT Server device is successful, the USER_LED1 will turn ON.

After the BLE connection is established, the notifications are enabled to receive data from the GATT Server using the CCCD handle of the *CapSense_DS* characteristic. Once notifications are enabled, the tuner bridge initialization parameters such as size of CapSense context structure and the number of notification packets required to send the complete CapSense context structure are received from the peer GATT Server device. This is used to set the size of the EZI2C buffer.

When you change the CapSense hardware parameters such as resolution, number of sub-conversions, and so on from the CapSense Tuner GUI, the Tuner GUI modifies the CapSense context structure (EZI2C buffer).

The application does the following:

 * Checks if a notification event is received from the GATT Server device through the *CapSense_DS* characteristic. Once a notification containing CapSense context structure is received, it is loaded to the EZI2C buffer to be read by the CapSense Tuner (I2C Master).

 * Checks if a I2C write event has been triggered by the CapSense Tuner (I2C Master). Once write event is received, the application finds the offset, number of bytes modified, and the data written on the CapSense context structure by the CapSense Tuner. This data is communicated to the peer GATT Server through a GATT write command using the *Tuner_Command* characteristic handle.
