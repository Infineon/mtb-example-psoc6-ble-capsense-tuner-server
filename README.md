# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: Tuning CapSense&trade; over Bluetooth&reg; LE  - server

This code example demonstrates how to monitor the CapSense&trade; data and tune CapSense&trade; sensors over Bluetooth&reg; LE communication with CapSense&trade; tuner GUI using PSoC™ 6 CY8C63x7 MCU with AIROC™ Bluetooth® LE.

## Overview

This code example has two applications:

1. **Tuning CapSense&trade; over Bluetooth&reg; LE - server:** This design has a self-capacitance (CSD) based 5-segment CapSense&trade; slider and two mutual capacitance (CSX)-based CapSense&trade; buttons. It has a PSoC™ 6 CY8C63x7 MCU with AIROC™ Bluetooth® LE configured as a Bluetooth&reg; LE Peripheral and GATT Server that sends CapSense&trade; raw data to the GATT Client. This project should be run on a board with CapSense&trade; sensors that needs to be tuned over Bluetooth&reg; LE communication.

2. **Tuning CapSense&trade; over Bluetooth&reg; LE - client:** The design has a PSoC™ 6 CY8C63x7 MCU with AIROC™ Bluetooth® LE configured as a GATT Client to receive CapSense&trade; raw data from a GATT Server. It also has an EZI2C interface to communicate with the CapSense&trade; tuner. This project needs to be run on a board that has Bluetooth&reg; LE capability and has a connection to the CapSense&trade; tuner through the EZI2C interface.

**Note:** This code example shows the GATT Server-side of the example project. See [PSoC™ 6 MCU: tuning CapSense&trade; over Bluetooth&reg; LE- client](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-ble-capsense-tuner-client) for the GATT Client-side of the project.

For more details on monitoring CapSense&trade; data, tuning CapSense&trade; parameter tuning, and measuring SNR, see the CapSense&trade; tuner guide. See [AN85951 – PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CapSense&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an85951-psoc-4-and-psoc-6-mcu-capsense-design-guide) for more details on selecting the right tuning parameters.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

### Tuning CapSense&trade; over Bluetooth&reg; LE - server

The design has a PSoC™ 6 CY8C63x7 MCU with AIROC™ Bluetooth® LE device configured as a GAP Peripheral and a GATT Server with the *CapSense_Tuner* custom service. This service has two custom characteristics: *CapSense_DS* and *Tuner_Command*. The *CapSense_DS* characteristic is loaded with the CapSense&trade; context structure *cy_capsense_tuner*. The *Tuner_Command* characteristic is used to receive command packets from the GATT Client which were received from the CapSense&trade; tuner. This code example supports 2M PHY and data length extension (DLE) features to maximize the throughput.

The design also has a CSD-based, 5-segment CapSense&trade; slider and two CSX-based CapSense&trade; buttons. The project uses the CapSense&trade; middleware. See [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/504361/download) for more details on selecting a middleware. See [AN85951 – PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CapSense&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an85951-psoc-4-and-psoc-6-mcu-capsense-design-guide) for more details of CapSense&trade; features and usage.

#### Firmware flow

When the kit is powered up, the CapSense&trade; and Bluetooth&reg; LE blocks are initialized. The PSoC™ 6 CY8C63x7 MCU with AIROC™ Bluetooth® LE device is configured as Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Peripheral and GATT Server. The Bluetooth&reg; LE initialization function initializes the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack and registers the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack event handler (an application-level callback function to process Bluetooth&reg; LE events). The *tuner_send_callback* function (an application-level callback function to facilitate data transmission using Bluetooth&reg; LE) is registered in the CapSense&trade; middleware to send the *cy_capsense_tuner* CapSense&trade; context structure to the GATT Client.

When the Bluetooth&reg; LE connection to the GATT Client device is successful, USER_LED1 will turn ON.

After a successful Bluetooth&reg; LE connection, the GATT Client enables the notifications of the *CapSense_DS* characteristic using client characteristic configuration descriptor (CCCD). Once notifications are enabled, tuner bridge initialization parameters such as the size of CapSense&trade; context structure and the number of notification packets required to send the complete CapSense&trade; context structure are sent to the peer GATT Client device.

The application periodically scans the CapSense&trade; buttons for user inputs. The `Cy_CapSense_RunTuner()` function is called periodically in the application program to establish synchronized communication with the CapSense&trade; tuner application. The `Cy_CapSense_RunTuner()` function calls the user-registered callback function `tuner_send_callback` to send the CapSense&trade; data structure `cy_capsense_tuner`  to the GATT Client. The `cy_capsense_tuner` structure is sent as notification packets using the *CapSense_DS* characteristic.

When you change the CapSense&trade; hardware parameters such as resolution, number of sub-conversions, and so on from the CapSense&trade; tuner, it modifies the CapSense&trade; context structure. The GATT Server receives this as a write command through the *Tuner_Command* characteristic. The write command contains the offset address of the CapSense&trade; context structure that is modified, actual data modified, and the number of bytes modified by the CapSense&trade; tuner. The application is notified of this event through the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack event handler. The application then modifies the CapSense&trade; context structure directly using this information.

### Tuning CapSense&trade; over Bluetooth&reg; LE - client

The design has a PSoC™ 6 CY8C63x7 MCU with AIROC™ Bluetooth® LE device configured as Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Central and GATT Client with the *CapSense_Tuner* custom service. The design also uses a serial communication block  (SCB) configured as EZIZC to establish I2C communication with the onboard KitProg, which enables the CapSense&trade; tuner to read the CapSense&trade; raw data. The CapSense&trade; tuner is a standalone tool that runs on a PC, and is included in the ModusToolbox&trade; software to tune CapSense&trade; applications. This code example supports 2M PHY and data length extension (DLE) features to maximize the throughput.

#### **Firmware flow**

When the kit is powered up, the Bluetooth&reg; LE and SCB (configured as EZI2C) blocks are initialized. The Bluetooth&reg; LE initialization function initializes the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack and registers the Bluetooth&reg; LE stack event handler (an application-level callback function to process Bluetooth&reg; LE events).

When the Bluetooth&reg; LE connection to the GATT Server device is successful, USER_LED1 will turn ON.

After the Bluetooth&reg; LE connection is established, the notifications are enabled to receive data from the GATT Server using the CCCD handle of the *CapSense_DS* characteristic. Once notifications are enabled, the tuner bridge initialization parameters such as size of CapSense&trade; context structure and the number of notification packets required to send the complete CapSense&trade; context structure are received from the peer GATT Server device. This is used to set the size of the EZI2C buffer.

When you change the CapSense&trade; hardware parameters such as resolution, number of sub-conversions, and so on from the CapSense&trade; tuner, it modifies the CapSense&trade; context structure (EZI2C buffer).

The application does the following:

 - Checks whether a notification event is received from the GATT Server device through the *CapSense_DS* characteristic. Once a notification containing the CapSense&trade; context structure is received, it is loaded to the EZI2C buffer to be read by the CapSense&trade; tuner (I2C Master).

 - Checks whether a I2C write event has been triggered by the CapSense&trade; tuner (I2C master). Once write event is received, the application finds the offset, number of bytes modified, and the data written on the CapSense&trade; context structure by the CapSense&trade; tuner. This data is communicated to the peer GATT Server through a GATT write command using the *Tuner_Command* characteristic handle.
